## General info and motivation
In this project, I will investigate the decisive factors of compensation (converted) arround the world.

I want to examine in the year of 2020, what is the decisive factor in programmers compensation. Therefore, I use the dataset of stackoverflow 2020 to conduct the analysis.

## Major Findings
In this project, we have the following comments on compensation.

* The most decisive feature in one’s compensation is the compensation frequency. Those received compensation weekly enjoy higher compensation, compared to those received compensation annually.

* Yet country differentiation in one’s compensation is still significant. Those worked in developed countries have higher compensation.

* Those worked partime, solo or in small firms in general have lower compensation. And those high compensation programmers have their preferred database for next year.

While the globe is suffered from pandemic last year in 2020, it can be predicted that the compensation in last year will change significantly. Let’s wait and see the Stackoverflow Dataset 2021 for the trend of programmers’ compensation.
